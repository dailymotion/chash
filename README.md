Introduction
============

Consistent hashing is a scheme that provides hash table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one slot does not significantly change the mapping of keys to slots. In contrast, in most traditional hash tables, a change in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped. By using consistent hashing, only K/n keys need to be remapped on average, where K is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots.

CHash is Dailymotion's implementation of consistent hashing, available as a light and fast C library (both static and shared objects provided), with PHP and Python bindings.

Useful pointers
===============

Below are some useful pointers pertaining to consistent hashing in general and the CHash implementation in particular:

* The [Wikipedia definition page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing)
* An  [interesting blog entry](http://www.spiteful.com/2008/03/17/programmers-toolbox-part-3-consistent-hashing) on consistent hashing
* Another [blog entry](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/archive/2007/11/consistent_hash.html) on the same subject

Compilation and installation
============================

C libraries
-----------

The base C libraries are generated by invoking the following commands:

    git clone git://github.com/dailymotion/chash.git
    cd chash/library
    make

The corresponding Debian packages (libchash1 and libchash-dev) are then generated by invoking the following command:

    make deb

Installing the generated packages is performed via the following commands (where <arch> is either i386 or amd64):

    cd ..
    sudo dpkg -i libchash1_1.0.0_<arch>.deb
    sudo dpkg -i libchash-dev_1.0.0_<arch>.deb

Please note that the packages will only be generated if the C libraries unitary tests pass successfully.

PHP and HHVM extension
-------------

The PHP and HHVM extension is generated by invoking the following commands:

    git clone git://github.com/dailymotion/chash.git
    cd chash/php
    sudo make -f Makefile.chash

The corresponding Debian package (php5-chash and hhvm-chash) is then generated by invoking the following command:

    sudo make -f Makefile.chash deb

Installing the generated package is performed via the following commands (where <arch> is either i386 or amd64):

    cd ..
    sudo dpkg -i php5-chash_1.0.0_<arch>.deb
    sudo dpkg -i hhvm-chash_1.0.0_<arch>.deb

Please note that the packages will only be generated if the PHP extension unitary tests pass successfully.

Python extension

C API
=====

General usage
-------------

The C API evolves around a unique structure (CHASH_CONTEXT) and a bunch of functions performing
action on that structure (mimicking an object-oriented behavior) . To use this API, you must first
include [libchash.h](http://git.dailymotion.com/component/chash.git/?a=blob;f=library/libchash.h),
declare an instance of the CHASH_CONTEXT structure, initialize it (using chash_initialize) then use
the various functions as needed. The final compiled code must be linked to the libchash.a or libchash.so
library (you'll probably need to pass the -lchash option to your linker).

A very basic example is provided below:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <libchash.h>

    int main()
    {
        CHASH_CONTEXT context = {0};
        char          *target;

        chash_initialize(&context, 0);
        chash_add_target(&context, "target001", 1);
        chash_add_target(&context, "target002", 1);
        chash_add_target(&context, "target003", 1);
        chash_add_target(&context, "target004", 1);
        chash_add_target(&context, "target005", 1);
        chash_lookup_balance(&context, "candidate001", 3, &target);
        printf("%s\n", target);
        chash_terminate(&context, 0);
        return 0;
    }

Assuming the above example code was saved under sample.c, it can be compiled using the following command:

    gcc -Wall -O3 sample.c -o sample -lchash

Error codes
-----------

Most of the C API functions return an error code (a negative integer) when an error occurs.
The list of the possible values and their meaning is provided below:

* *CHASH_ERROR_DONE* (0)
The function executed properly.

* *CHASH_ERROR_MEMORY* (-1)
A memory allocation error occurred.

* *CHASH_ERROR_IO* (-2)
A file I/O error occurred.

* *CHASH_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER* (-10)
An invalid parameter was provided.

* *CHASH_ERROR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED* (-11)
The context is already initialized.

* *CHASH_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED* (-12)
The requested action cannot be performed because the context was not properly initialized.

* *CHASH_ERROR_NOT_FOUND* (-13)
The requested data cannot be found.

PHP API
=======

General usage
-------------

The PHP API is more or less mapped onto and modelled after the C API (see above). An exact equivalent of the basic C example would be:

    $chash = new CHash();
    $chash->setTargets
    (
        array
        (
            'target001' => 1,
            'target002' => 1,
            'target003' => 1,
            'target004' => 1,
            'target005' => 1
        )
    );
    print $chash->lookupBalance('candidate001', 3) . "\n";

Error codes
-----------

The error codes from the C API are available verbatim the PHP extension. Because the initialization and termination of the C API context structure is performed by the PHP Zend object management functions, the *CHASH_ERROR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED* and *CHASH_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED* will never occur in the PHP extension. The list of the possible values and their meaning is provided below:

* *CHASH_ERROR_DONE* (0)
The function executed properly.

* *CHASH_ERROR_MEMORY* (-1)
A memory allocation error occurred.

* *CHASH_ERROR_IO* (-2)
A file I/O error occurred.

* *CHASH_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER* (-10)
An invalid parameter was provided.

* *CHASH_ERROR_NOT_FOUND* (-13)
The requested data cannot be found.

Exceptions
----------

In addition to methods returning error codes, exceptions are thrown by the PHP extension should an error occur. The list of the possible exceptions and their meaning is provided below (the original error code is stored in the exception code value):

* *CHashMemoryException*
A memory allocation error occurred.

* *CHashIOException*
A file I/O error occurred.

* *CHashInvalidParameterException*
An invalid parameter was provided.

* *CHashNotFoundException*
The requested data cannot be found.

Note: the exceptions mode is activated by default, use the *useExceptions()* method below to disable it.
